## Table of Contents

## Overview
For our fourth and final project at **General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course** we were given 7 days to build a full stack website. After some consideration we deiced to build something that allows users to create and share their creations. 

**note-it-down** was born - an app to make short tunes in the scale of C major. 

We deployed our app using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Brief
- Choose to work as either pair, group or solo
- Build a full-stack application by making our own backend and frontend 
- Use a Python Django API, using Django REST Framework to serve our data from a PostgresSQL database
- Consume the API with  a separate frontend built with React
- Build a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
- Have a visually impressive design 
- Have it deployed online so it's publicly accessible

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (ES6)
- Python
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- React.js
- Tone.js
- SCSS
- HTML5
- Git and GitHub
- Cloudinary
- Google Chrome Dev Tools
- Noun Project
- Excalidraw
- Heroku and Netlify

## Approach 
We started by planning out the layout of our website and understanding exactly how we would like to style it. We knew our models would not be very complex so our focus was to complete the backend in 2 days and transition into working with **Tone.js** and making our app look stunning.

### Whiteboarding
From the beginning, we had a good sense of direction and an idea of what the project will look like. The vision was clear, and in the end the final product closely resembled the initial sketch we made on [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).
